The average or recommended time for a pull request to complete all necessary
tests, security checks, and linting depends on the complexity of your project
and the goals of your CI/CD pipeline. Here’s a general guideline:

# Recommended Time:

* Small to Medium Projects: 5–15 minutes
* Large Projects: 15–30 minutes
* Highly Complex Systems: Up to 1 hour (with parallelization and optimizations)

# Factors Influencing Duration:

## Project Size and Test Complexity:

Smaller projects or those with fewer tests naturally take less time.
For large systems with extensive tests (e.g., integration tests or performance tests), longer durations might be unavoidable.

## Infrastructure:

Leveraging fast CI/CD infrastructure or cloud runners can reduce wait times.
Parallelizing tasks (e.g., splitting test suites or running linting, tests, and security checks concurrently) can significantly optimize durations.

## Types of Tests:

* Linting: Usually completes in under 1–5 minutes, depending on the codebase size.
* Unit Tests: Typically completes in 1–10 minutes for most projects.
* Integration/End-to-End Tests: May take 10–30 minutes or more, depending on system complexity.
* Security Scans: May add 5–15 minutes, though tools like Dependabot or Snyk can help automate and speed up this process.

## Developer Experience:

Teams aim for CI pipelines to complete within 10–15 minutes to avoid disrupting developer productivity.
Delays beyond this can lead to context-switching, reducing developer focus and efficiency.

# Optimizations:

## Parallelization:

Run linting, tests, and security checks simultaneously.
Use tools like pytest-xdist (for Python) or Jest's parallel runners (for JavaScript).

## Incremental Testing:

Run only tests affected by changes in the pull request (e.g., test selection based on file changes).
Pre-Check Hooks:

Run linting and unit tests locally before committing, ensuring CI only validates changes.

## Caching:

Cache dependencies (e.g., node_modules, Docker layers) and test artifacts to speed up builds.

## Fast Feedback:

Run fast, high-confidence checks (e.g., linting and unit tests) first and allow
merging after these pass, deferring slower tests to post-merge.
